# Marketing Data Analysis and Prediction

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing marketing data and predicting sales using linear regression. The dataset used for analysis is loaded from 'Marketing_Data.csv'. The script utilizes popular Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.

# Code Structure

'MultipleLinearRegression.ipynb':The main Python script containing data loading, preprocessing, linear regression modeling, and gradient descent implementation.

# Dataset
The marketing dataset (Marketing_Data.csv) includes columns for advertising expenses on YouTube, Facebook, and newspaper, along with corresponding sales data.

# Linear Regression Model
A linear regression model is trained on the dataset to predict sales based on advertising expenses. The script includes visualization of the model's performance using scatter plots and regression lines.

# Gradient Descent Implementation
The script also demonstrates a gradient descent implementation for model optimization. The optimal theta values are computed and used for predictions.


# Results
The results of the linear regression model and gradient descent optimization are visualized using scatter plots and regression lines.
